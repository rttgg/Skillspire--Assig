            <p><ul> - If there's no current object,<b> 'this'</b> refers to the global object.<bk>
                In a web browser, that's 'window'- the top-level object which represents<bk>
                     the document, location, history and a few other useful properties and methods.</ul>
               <ul> - <b>'this'</b> remains the global object if you're calling a function</ul>
                <ul>- When calling an object constructor or any of its methods,<b> 'this'</b> refers to the instance of the object - 
                    <bk>much like any class-based language</ul>
