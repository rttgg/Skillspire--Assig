        <h2>Higher-Order Function</h2>
        
        <div><p>
                Functions are values, all simple functions can be compose together using higher order function.
                Just like string, numbers…functions can be assigned to variables or passing to <strong>higher order function</strong> composition. <br>Higher order function good for composition.
                One function put in other function allows us to compose a lot of small functions into bigger higher order function.
                <br> <strong>Higher order methods are </strong>
                <ul>
                <li>For Each</li>
                <li>Filter</li>
                <li>Map</li>
                <li>Sort</li>
                <li>Reduce</li>
                </ul>
                
                ---<strong> Let’s look at filter method </strong><br>
               <b><i> Filter method </b></i> allows us to do just filter things out from the array.
                Filter will loop through each item in the array and for each item it’s 
                going to pass it into the callback function and when it does it expect the 
                function to return either true or false.
                <br>
                ---<strong> Let’s look at Map method </strong><br>
                <b><i> Map method </b></i> instead of filtering things out we can create 
                new arrays of anything from a current array. <br> <b>Map </b> expect the call back 
                to return to any object. We can use it to create completely new objects.
                <br>
                ---<strong> Let’s look at reduce </strong><br>
                <b><i> Reduce method </b></i> is the multi-use, Reduce is a function on the
                 array object and just like map and filter it takes a callback function
                  but <b> unlike </b> map and filter it wants an object, the object will use it as 
                  a starting point for the function to be passed as the first argument to 
                  reduce method.
